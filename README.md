⚠️ WARNING: USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

This project, ChaosEngine, is designed to demonstrate the potential consequences of an infinite loop executed through a Batch script. Running this script will cause your system to open multiple Command Prompt windows continuously, which may result in:

System slowdown or freezing

High CPU and memory usage

Potential system crashes requiring a forced reboot


Purpose

The purpose of this project is to highlight how malicious scripts can exploit simple loops to disrupt system performance. It is intended for educational and research purposes only.

Solutions and Safety Precautions

1. Run in a Virtual Machine (VM): Always test potentially harmful scripts in a controlled environment like a VM to avoid damaging your main system.


2. Use Task Manager to Stop It: If the script causes instability, open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc) and manually end all cmd.exe processes.


3. Modify for Controlled Execution: Consider adding an exit condition or a loop limit to prevent infinite execution.



Legal and Ethical Disclaimer

This script is not intended for malicious use. Misuse of this code to harm or disrupt systems is illegal and unethical. The author takes no responsibility for any damage or loss resulting from the use of this script.

Proceed with caution and responsibility.
